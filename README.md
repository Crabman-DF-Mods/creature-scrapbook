# Creature Scrapbook - v1.0 [50.01]

This mod for [Dwarf Fortress][Dwarf_Fortress] adds a bunch of creature variations, body detail plans, body parts and materials, for other mods to build off of. Instead of repeatedly copying large chunks of tokens/code again and again between objects, you can end up with much smaller and more maintainable ones, and mods with fewer objects for you to keep track of.

This mod will not add or change basically anything about the vanilla game, it's only a core/base for other mods to make use of.

You can download this mod from:
- Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2899540654
- DFFD download: https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=16201

This mod was created with the help of the [Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension][LS], which I highly recommend to anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.
