A bunch of creature variations, body detail plans, body parts and materials, for other mods to build off of. Does nothing by itself, but is depended on by other mods.

This mod was created with the help of the [url=https://gitlab.com/df-modding-tools/df-raw-language-server]Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension[/url], which I highly recommend to anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.
